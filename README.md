# Short-Term Load Forecasting Using Artificial Neural Networks
This repository contains the code for my Bachelor's thesis project on Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF) using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The project was supervised by [Prof. Seyed Hossein Hosseinian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j0kjquUAAAAJ&hl=en) and completed at [Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)](https://aut.ac.ir/en). It focuses on predicting short-term electricity demand by leveraging time series data and various machine learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs).

## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to enhance the accuracy of short-term load forecasting, which is critical for electricity grid management, resource allocation, and ensuring a stable energy supply. By using neural networks, this project explores how deep learning models can better capture complex patterns in electrical load data and improve prediction performance compared to traditional forecasting techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle: [Electricity Load Forecasting Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/electricity-load-forecasting). It includes time-stamped electricity demand data along with weather features.
